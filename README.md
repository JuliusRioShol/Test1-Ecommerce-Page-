Advance Databases - Test 1
E-commerce Web application


Clone using: https://github.com/JuliusRioShol/Test1-Ecommerce-Page-.git

Working functionalities:
Loading webpages: Home page, Shop page, Product page( where you can add to cart),
Adding to cart( inserts a new order into the orders databases)

For the migrations, the make users is supposed to be the first migration to be run, so users table should be made first before the other tables.
Did not implement the users functionalities: like add user, login, validation. 
For the users table: there is one user that i manually had to add, in order to have the web app running at this point.

The required data is in the inserts.txt
